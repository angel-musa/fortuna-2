# Fortuna - Stock Analysis and Forecasting App ðŸ’¸

Fortuna is a Streamlit-based application designed to help users analyze stocks, forecast future prices, and perform sentiment analysis based on social media data. The app features a user-friendly interface with various tools and functionalities to assist with investment decisions.

## Features

- **Stock Overview**: Get detailed information about a stock, including its sector, industry, website, and a company overview.
- **Financials**: View key financial metrics such as revenue, earnings, EPS, PE ratio, and profit margins.
- **Latest News**: Stay updated with the latest news articles related to the selected stock.
- **Forecast**: Forecast future stock prices using machine learning models, and visualize the results with interactive plots.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze the sentiment of social media posts related to a specific stock. The sentiment images are updated automatically every hour and stored in the GitHub repository.

## How It Works

### 1. Authentication
The app features a login system where users can log in to access their personalized watchlist. After logging in, users can add stocks to their watchlist and view the corresponding stock data.

### 2. Stock Data Rendering
Users can select a stock from the available list, and the app will render detailed information about the stock, including financial data, news articles, and forecasted prices.

### 3. Sentiment Analysis
The sentiment analysis tool searches for a company's sentiment image within a folder called `company_images` in the repository. These images are generated by the `image_fetcher.py` script, which runs every hour on a local machine, fetching the latest sentiment data and saving the images to the `sentiment_images` folder. The folder is then automatically pushed to the GitHub repository.

### 4. Automated Sentiment Image Fetcher
The `image_fetcher.py` script runs every hour using a scheduled task on the local machine. It reads company names from an Excel file (`data new.xlsx`, sheet `short`), fetches sentiment images using a headless browser, and saves the images as `{company_name}.png` in the `sentiment_images` folder. The updated images are then committed and pushed to the GitHub repository.

### 5. Watchlist Functionality
Users can add stocks to their watchlist, which is saved in a database (`watchlist.db`). The watchlist is loaded upon login, allowing users to easily manage and view their favorite stocks.
